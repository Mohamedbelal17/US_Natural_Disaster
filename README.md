🌀 US_Natural_Disaster Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing and extracting insights from the US Natural Disaster dataset, applying a full data science pipeline — including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

📊 Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw disaster data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply supervised learning models for prediction (e.g., classification or regression)

Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means Clustering) to group similar disaster events

Identify trends and patterns to support risk assessment and disaster preparedness

🧹 Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Standardized column names and formats

Encoded categorical features where necessary

Normalized numerical values for modeling

🔍 Analysis & Features
EDA using visualizations to understand disaster frequency, impact, and location-based trends

Feature engineering from raw fields to improve model performance

Correlation and statistical analysis to identify important variables

🤖 Machine Learning
Supervised Learning
Applied models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest for classification tasks (e.g., predicting disaster impact level)

Unsupervised Learning
Implemented K-Means Clustering to discover patterns and group disaster types or regions with similar characteristics

📁 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV dataset of US natural disasters

📈 Results
Identified high-risk states and frequent disaster types

Clustered disasters into meaningful groups using K-Means

Built predictive models to estimate disaster severity or response needs

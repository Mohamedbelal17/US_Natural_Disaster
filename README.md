# 🌀 US_Natural_Disaster Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the **US Natural Disaster dataset**, covering the full data science pipeline — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to applying both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques, including **K-Means clustering**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw disaster data  
- Explore data trends and insights through EDA  
- Apply **supervised learning** to predict disaster impact  
- Use **unsupervised learning** to group similar disaster events  
- Support risk assessment and disaster preparedness

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Standardized formats and column names  
- Encoded categorical data for ML models  
- Normalized numerical fields

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identified disaster frequency and impact by region  
- Visualized trends over time and types of disasters  
- Engineered features to enhance predictive modeling

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning

### ✅ Supervised Learning
- Models: `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`  
- Goal: Predict disaster impact level or damage severity

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
- Algorithm: `K-Means Clustering`  
- Goal: Group disasters or regions with similar characteristics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **CSV Dataset** (US Natural Disasters)

---

## 📈 Results

- Clustered states by disaster frequency and type  
- Built accurate models to predict disaster-related outcomes  
- Uncovered insights for better disaster preparedness
